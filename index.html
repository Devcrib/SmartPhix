          <h4>Pimped Phone</h4>
          <p>"I got tired of my phone because it has become boring to me. I could not even upgrade my OS. I was searching online on how to upgrade my phone when I came across this site. I saw the pimp your phone option so I decided to give it a try not expecting much actually. but to my surprise, i got my phone back in exactly 5 days which first amused me and I discovered that my phone was perfectly twerked. The way I love this phone now, no one would ever believe I was thinking of even diposing it."</p>
