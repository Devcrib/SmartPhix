             <p>We are a phone repair company, we've served customers in their hundreds and we've had 90% of them grateful and satisfied with our service. We repair various kinds of phones (smartphones),
             with repairs ranging from cracked screens to minor button fixes to restoring dead phones (which died during immersion); we are an adventurous group, hence our 'speciale'- compete device makeover "(think of the pimp my ride show).
             Being a passionate set of forward-thinking, customer first individuals, our team believes that our customers desrve the best treatment, so every repair comes with a perk- and yeah, you get to choose.
             What our clients think about us and our services is primal in our hearts, we hold them in high regard and love to show off mind-blowing thank-you notes we've received.
